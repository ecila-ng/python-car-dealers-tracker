# python-car-dealers-tracker
ðŸš— An interactive computer program that keeps track of car dealers, cars, and a list of manufacturers. Prompt user for commands. 

Filename: main.py

Completed: 9/9/2019

Platform developed: Windows 10

## problem statement: 
The program should essentially prompt the user to enter a one letter command, and process the command as follows:
#### a (add), which should then read in one of:
- c, which should then also read the next string as a 17 character VIN string (more on this later), followed by the (integer number of 
miles the car has been driven, a string (with no spaces in it) representing the name of a dealership, and finally an integer 
representing the current price of the car (in dollars). So, the following: a c JHM12345678901234 17900 Weber 1995 should add a car with a VIN of JHM12345678901234 that has been driven for 
17900 miles to the Weber dealershipâ€™s inventory at a price of $1995.

- m, which should then read the next 3 character string as an abbreviation for a manu-facturer, followed by a string representing 
the actual name of the manufacturer. So, the following:a m JHM Honda should add a manufacturer named Honda, with a code of JHM. Note that the 3 characters in this code 
correspond to the first three characters of a VIN.

- d, which should then read the next string as dealer name, the following integer as a zipcode and then a 10 digit string as a phone
number. a d Fusz 63122 3149665404 should add a dealer named Fusz in zip code 63122 with phone number(314)966-5404.

#### l (list), which should then read in one of:
- c, which should list all of the cars across all dealerships. Each car should have its VIN, mileage, dealer name, and price printed.
- d, which should listallof the dealers. Each dealer printed out should include its name,its zipcode, and its phone number.

#### f (find), which should also read in one of the following characters:
- m, followed by the name of a manufacturer. It should then list all cars made by that manufacturer. 
- z, followed by a zipcode. It should list all cars available at dealers in that zip code.

#### q (quit), which should stop the running program.

## read.me:
I use 3 different lists to store data. 

- list1 stores data of all cars
- list2 stores data of all manufacturers
- list3 stores data of all dealers

There was no usage of external text file.

The data is stored as how it is entered and is only split when needed.

There are also 2 functions besides the main one.

find_phone_number receives dealer's name and returns that dealer's number
VIN_to_name receives the car's VIN and returns the car's manufacturer

If the user enters something else besides those commands listed, the program will
return nothing and continue to prompt the user to enter another command. 
This program does not have any exception handler. 

#### Log

I first started with C++ but it was a pain so I switched to Python.
It took me 2 days (15 hours total) to finish the core using Python. One extra
day to format and make everything looks pretty. 

I could have made it better by naming variables less confusing and using functions
instead of blocks of similar codes but I'll save that for future projects.
